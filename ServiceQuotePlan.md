#goal

create a calculator for service providers to give properly priced quotes to potential customers. The following inputs 
should be used:

- Current regional market rate
- Market demand
- Job details 
    - What the job entails
    - Emergency or not
    - Location (How much travel time will there be)
    - Job duration/complexity level
    - Materials needed (if applicable)
    - Time of day (for emergency services)
    - Seasonal factors
- Competitor pricing (optional)
- Service provider experience level
- Equipment requirements

The calculator should output:
- Estimated quote (primary price)
- Price range (minimum to maximum)
- Price breakdown showing factor influences
- Different pricing tiers (basic, premium, emergency)
- Quote validity period

# Technology

Use standard web development technology. The implementation 
should not depend on any software other than a standard
web browser. The code should only include HTML. CSS and 
vanilla JavaScript. Do not use any JaavaScript(or other 
types of frameworks). Use only vanilla CSS - no other tools 
should be required.

# Implementation step 1

Only code the HTML. The actual output does not
need to be generated correctly, as that would probably 
require JavaScript and you're not to do that at this step.
DO not use CSS at this point yet. We will do this in the next step.

# Implementation step 2

Use CSS to improve the design and then make the website
look nice and modern with a good look and feel - good
UI and UX.

# Implementation step 3

Add JavaScript to the code. The outputs should be
generated correctly
