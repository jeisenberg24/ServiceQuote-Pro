# ServiceQuote Pro - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

**Product Name:** ServiceQuote Pro

**Elevator Pitch:** ServiceQuote Pro is an intelligent pricing calculator that helps service providers generate accurate, competitive quotes for their customers by analyzing regional market rates, job complexity, and business factors. Our platform eliminates guesswork in pricing, ensuring service providers maximize profitability while remaining competitive in their local markets.

**Core Problem:** Service providers struggle with accurate pricing, often losing money through underpricing or losing customers through overpricing, leading to inconsistent revenue and customer satisfaction.

## 2. Problem Statement & Opportunity

**The Problem:** Service providers across various industries (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, landscaping, etc.) face significant challenges in pricing their services accurately. They often rely on outdated pricing methods, gut feelings, or simple cost-plus calculations that don't account for market dynamics, job complexity, or competitive positioning.

**Why This Matters:** 
- **Frequency:** Pricing decisions happen multiple times daily for active service providers
- **Impact:** Poor pricing can result in 20-40% revenue loss through underpricing or lost customers through overpricing
- **Affected Users:** Over 2 million service providers in the US alone struggle with pricing accuracy

**Current Alternatives & Shortcomings:**
- **Manual estimation:** Time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error
- **Simple cost-plus pricing:** Ignores market conditions and competitive factors
- **Generic pricing guides:** Not tailored to local markets or specific job types
- **Competitor price checking:** Reactive approach that doesn't account for business factors
